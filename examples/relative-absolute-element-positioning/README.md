# Relative and Absolute Element Positioning :rocket:

These positioning schemes allow you to specify precise offsets to move the target element 
to the different part of the page origin.
Static positioning is basically a different way of saying normal document flow. 
It is actually a default setting for all elements, except html.

## Relative positioning

```
Element is positioned relative to its position in normal
document flow
```

## Absolute positioning

```
All offsets are relative to the position of the nearest ancestor
which has positioning set on it, other than static
